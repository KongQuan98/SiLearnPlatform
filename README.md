<h3>Brief Summary 📝</h3>

  - This is the Final Year Project for my Computer Science Degree which:
      - Built on Android Studio (Java) 🤖
      - Integrated with OpenCV library along with model trained with pre-trained CNN image classification model of EfficientNetB0
  - A sign language learning platform for everyone to start learning fundamental of sign language efficiently with the use of sign language recognition system.

<h3>Tech Stack 💻</h3>

- Android Java (Main codebase for building Android project)
- Python (Script for training model)
- OpenCV libraries & tensorflow lite (Integrate into Android project)
- Firebase Auth & Store (User authentication & storing images)
- Canva (Draw & design logo and image assets)

<h3>Some Project Background 🍦</h3>

- The deaf-mute community has been facing a lot of communication difficulties as they are unable to speak with other people. 🗣️
- In a recent event occurred in [Baskin Robin retail store in  Malaysia🇲🇾](https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2021/06/10/malaysian-baskin-robbins-employee-praised-for-serving-deaf-customer-despite/1981141#google_vignette), a worker was trying his best to serve a deaf customer despite the communication barrier. This has provided a great insight for this project to help the public to understand more about sign language which used by the deaf-mute community and treat them equally.
- The Sign Learner Platform is proposed to develop an educational learning platform to encourage the public for learning the sign language as an extra knowledge. 📈
- This system will be utilizing the [artificial intelligence technologies](https://keras.io/api/applications/efficientnet/) to perform real-time recognition on sign language and word prediction to produce the accurate word text. 🈁
- This project is expected to increase the exposure of deaf-mute culture to the public and ensure that the deaf-mute community can be treated equally.
- In short, the initiative of this project is to minimize the communication barrier between the deaf-mute community and the public around the globe.
